# Mousepad Friction Tester

## About
The Mousepad Friction Tester analyzes mouse movement to calculate the dynamic friction coefficients of a mousepad. It generates plots of mousepad dynamic friction, mouse position, distance, velocity, and acceleration.
These plots can be used to assess mousepad performance.
Additionally, a complementary CSV file is generated.

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Environment**
   - Adjust the "Inputs" in the code as needed.
   - Lower your mouse DPI setting.

2. **Run the Code**
   - Execute the script and flick your mouse, then let it move freely.
   - Once the mouse stops, repeat the process in the opposite direction.
   - Continue this process throughout the total run time.

3. **Testing Tips**
   - Avoid using the corners of the monitor, as they may affect the calculations.

4. **Post-Test**
   - The script will extract periods of negative acceleration (when your hand leaves the mouse) and calculate the average dynamic friction.
   - Graphs of the results will be generated and saved in the same folder where the code was executed.
