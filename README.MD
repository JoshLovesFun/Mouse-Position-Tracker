**Instructions for Mouse Position Tracker:**

Please see the first few lines of the code. These lines are duplicated here for your convenience.

# Change the "Inputs" as needed, lower the mouse DPI, then run the code. Flick
# your mouse, then let go, so it is free-moving. When the mouse stops, repeat
# in the opposite direction. Continue this throughout the total run time.
# Avoid corners of the monitor as calculations may be affected. When testing is
# complete, the code will extract the negative acceleration periods (when your
# hand leaves the mouse) and calculate the average dynamic friction. Graphs of
# the results will appear in the same folder where the code is run from.
