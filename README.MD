**About Mousepad Friction Tester:**
Analyzes mouse movement to calculate dynamic friction coefficients of mousepad.
Generates plots and CSV files of distance, velocity, and acceleration for assessing mousepad performance.

**Instructions for Mousepad Friction Tester:**

Please see the first few lines of the code for the instructions. These lines are shown below for your convenience.

Change the "Inputs" as needed, lower the mouse DPI, then run the code. Flick
your mouse, then let go, so it is free-moving. When the mouse stops, repeat
in the opposite direction. Continue this throughout the total run time.
Avoid corners of the monitor as calculations may be affected. When testing is
complete, the code will extract the negative acceleration periods (when your
hand leaves the mouse) and calculate the average dynamic friction. Graphs of
the results will appear in the same folder where the code is run from.
